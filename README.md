Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, characterized by its diverse cellular composition and complex microenvironment. Leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), this study aimed to characterize the cellular landscape of CRC across various tissue types, including normal, adenoma, carcinoma, para-cancerous, and blood samples from four patients (GSE161277 dataset). We employed the Seurat package for data integration and quality control, along with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for visualization and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) for batch effect correction. Our analysis revealed significant heterogeneity within and between tissue types, identifying distinct cell populations such as epithelial cells, immune cells, and stromal cells. Carcinoma tissues exhibited the highest cellular diversity, highlighting the complexity of the tumor microenvironment. These findings provide a detailed cellular atlas of CRC, enhancing our understanding of its pathogenesis and progression, and identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. These results pave the way for future research focused on improving CRC diagnosis and treatment strategies
